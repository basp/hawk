## Of The Languages
The **Omilu'e** is the oldest text that we have found so far and it is one of
the most important pieces of history we have on the forgotten language. 

Here it is in its raw (written) form as found on a wooden tablet that dates
back to more than 12000 years ago.

leenila<br>

manulina

One of the things that have puzzled historians and linguists is that the
writing style is *kaika* on wood. This writing style is typically only used 
for stone or rock. Since the **Omilu'e** is so old, it is speculated that the 
text might have been even older and was originally was written on stone 
somewhere (un-found) and has been copied over the ages to finally be copied on 
wooden tablets before it made its way into known history.

The free translation of the **Omilu'e**:
> At the place of the blue trees<br>
> I felt the wind<br>
> I heard the animals<br>
> And I saw the stars

And how it should be written in a gramatically consistent way:
> omi lua ke<br>
> leena ila<br>
> anee kupi<br>
> manu ulina

How do we get there though? Below is the glossary.

**omiluke**<br>
omi  lua  ke<br>
tree blue location/time<br>
*(at the) blue trees*

**leenila**<br>
leena ila<br>
skin wind<br>
*(I) felt the wind*

**anekupi**<br>
anee kupi<br>
ear animal<br>
*(I) heard the animals*

**manulina**<br>
manu ulina<br>
eye star<br>
*(And I) saw the stars*

We can see that in the earliest writings (like this one) there is not really a
concept of grammar. Words are basically concatenated as the speaker would say
them and these sounds are being written down. In this regard, the writings of
this time should be regarded as phonetic. We also see nouns being used to express 
verbs, adverbs and adjectives.

The **Omilu'e** is important because it is one of the first examples of actual
literature. Most of the other writings around this time are equivalent to what
we nowadays would call *graffiti*. Just people leaving their mark on their
surroundings. There are lots of examples where people just proclaim that they
wrote the thing they wrote.

**Pawa kaika pahipi**<br>
hand stone pahipi<br>
*Pahipi wrote this*

**Pawaikapamo**<br>
pawa kaika pamo<br>
hand stone Pamo<br>
*Pamo wrote this*

We can already see in these early examples that even though there is no notion
of verbs, the word that stands in for the verb (often body parts) is at the
beginning of the sentence. Actually we should say that the only reason this
works at all is *because* the "verb" (technically just a noun or noun 
combination) is supposed to be first. But because it is first we know that we
might have to interpret it as a verb instead of an noun.

Another important feature is that vowels are easily collapsed in common speech
and especially when writing down in earlier times. We already saw that
**pawa kaika pahipi** can easily turn into **pawaikapahipi** if the writer is
an especially phonetic mood. This sometimes makes it hard to decipher old texts
but since most of the concepts are noun based around word order it is not too
hard to make reasonable assumptions. The hard part is extracting the proper
names if no spaces or other markings are used.

For example, we have found **pawa kaika** (*hand stone*, "to carve") in various 
forms even in ancient writing:
* **pawakaika**
* **pawaika**
* **pawa'ika**
* **pawaka'ka**
* **pawaka'ika**

The glottal stop (`'`) is particularly prominent on the south island and in the
south of the north island. In the north, the vowels tend to collapse but in the
sound, often a stop is preferred but how it is actually placed and utilized
depends on the region.

## Writing on Wood
The first forms of writing consisted of people just carving whatever they could
spell into stone. But later came the writing on wood. Or **omipawa** writings.

At first these writings copied the **kaika** (*stone*) style to carve wood but 
eventually the **kinapawa** (*new/beginning hand*) style took over. This style 
was also known as **omipawa** (*tree/wood hand*).

Wood was more easily carved than was possible in stone and these writings 
usually came on small wooden tablets that were meant for everyday use. These 
were easy for people to carry around and to act as a substitute for money or 
possessions. This style originated on the south islands where trees were
plentiful. The **kaika** style remained in fashion in the north since smooth
rock was more plentiful there and they preferred the *harshness* of stone. 

## The Advent of Verbs
The most primitive of verb operations can be glimpsed from the **Omilu'e** 
itself. We can see that basic nouns are being used as verbs. For example, it
did not take long for the phrase **pawa kaika** (*hand stone*) to mean 
"to carve" since we can find it all over the place in that time period when
people learned to write. Hence it's also not surprising to find so much
variations of this term across the islands. Likewise we have **anee** (*ear*)
which is used as a verb in **anee kupi** (literally *ear animated-small*).

At this point the language just consist of putting nouns together in VSO order
and it settled on that system (mostly). If you want to say, "I see him." you 
would say "See me him.". It is unsure how these constructs would look like in
the forgotten language since these patterns typically don't appear in their
writings. We can assume that, in context, these matters would not be very
important. 

For example, assume there are two hunters hidden in the foliage
spying on their prey. We can reasonably assume the following conversation:
> **mana ookapi**<br>
> eye big animal<br>
> *Watch the big one*<br>
> 
> **mana**<br>
> eye<br>
> *I see it*

Rember that we are *pro-drop* so if we have a chance we drop pronouns and
assume first person if nothing else is clear from context.

Without context, **mana ookapi** could mean a lot of things:
* I see the big animal.
* Look at the big animal.
* Watch the big animal.
* There was a big animal.
* There's going to be a big animal.

In the primitive language, tense and aspect are not so important because we are
not using language to share written knowledge yet. This language exists only
as sounds and no written system has been developed. This makes it easy for the
language to change and adapt.



After the **manawi** (*opening of the mind*) we can see that language is
gradually becoming more complex.
